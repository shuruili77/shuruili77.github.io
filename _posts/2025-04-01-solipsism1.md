# A Minor Paradox of Solipsism
*Another Perspective on Solipsism, Part 1/2*  

---

## Preface

Solipsism is a question I’ve been obsessing over since childhood:  
If I am the only conscious being in this world, and everyone else is merely a simulation, a script, or an NPC—then can anything I experience truly be called “real”?  
There’s still no definitive answer to this question.

But last night, in a moment of deep contemplation, a new paradox occurred to me—  
Rather than directly refuting solipsism’s conclusion, it instead challenges the **mechanism required to sustain solipsism itself**.

## The Premise of Solipsism

At its core, solipsism asserts that:
- Only *I* possess true consciousness;
- Everything external—other people, environments, language, history—is either a construction of my own perception or a simulation orchestrated for me;
- I cannot verify the conscious existence of any “other.”

This line of thought is logically unfalsifiable.  
Any attempt at refutation could itself be interpreted as part of the illusion, or pre-programmed input.  
But precisely because of this, solipsism often ends up as a kind of philosophical dead-end, isolated and unresolvable.

## The Minor Paradox I Propose

While revisiting this topic last night, a paradoxical question emerged:

**“If all this is an illusion—then who is maintaining the illusion for me?”**

Let’s unpack this:

### 1. Illusions don’t arise from nothing

The world we perceive is structured, consistent, and follows causal laws.  
This illusion is not chaotic like a dream—it’s remarkably coherent and self-sustaining.  
If such an illusion exists solely for *me*, then it demands a mechanism that persistently generates and feeds these perceptions to me.

This mechanism must either be:
- Created by myself (e.g., I am a “true self” in slumber, unaware of the dream), or
- Operated by a higher-level entity—perhaps a simulator, a god, or a conscious system.

### 2. If such an entity exists…

Then this “simulator” must necessarily possess an existence and consciousness distinct from mine.  
It would have to *know*, *design*, and *maintain* the world’s complexity for me.

And here lies the paradox:

❗️**“If another conscious entity is simulating the world for me, then *I* am not the only conscious being.”**  
→ The “singularity” of solipsism is broken.

## In Short: A Contradiction in the Maintenance of Consciousness

This resembles a philosophical version of a “backend maintenance paradox”:
- You claim to be the sole user; all else is illusion.
- But to generate and sustain such a detailed illusion, a backend system is needed.
- If that backend has consciousness—you are no longer alone.
- If it doesn’t—how does it manage such realism, interactivity, consistency, and logic?

I don’t yet have a fully satisfying answer.  
But this line of questioning has shaken my certainty in the solipsistic claim of sole consciousness.

## Postscript

This piece isn’t a conclusion, but just a record of a mental leap.

Update: If you are interested, there is a follow-up blog on this.
