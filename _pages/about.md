[//]: # (This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).)

About myself
======
Hello! I'm Shurui Li, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at NanoCAD Lab, UCLA where I'm diving deep into the fascinating world of Efficient Deep Learning, Optical Neural Network, and Computer Architecture. My academic journey began at Imperial College London, where I completed my M.Eng. and B.Eng. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Afterwards I joined UCLA as a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering. 

<!-- Here says my resarch lies in the intersection of optics, comupter architecture, and deep learning -->

I've been fortunate to share some of my research findings through publications and presentations at conferences. It's always a thrill to engage with the wider scientific community and learn from others in my field.

Beyond my research, I've found great joy in teaching and mentoring. I've organized a bootcamp for incoming UCLA computer engineering freshmen and volunteered as an instructor for the Los Angeles Computing Circle. It's been a privilege to share my passion for computer engineering with the next generation of learners.
